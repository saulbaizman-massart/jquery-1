Though this repository contains a single file, this file should be seen as dozens of files (one file per commit). The important content is the [commit history](https://github.com/saulbaizman-massart/jquery-1/commits/master) which contains detailed annotations of the changes I made to the file. You can view the file at every step of the way and download a copy of the file at any point in time.
